	<h2>What We Do</h2>
		<p id="aboutp" > Here at We Deliver, we like to think that we're solving a problem. 
			The problem? Being able to eat restaurant quality food without going to a restaurant.
			Lets's face it, everyone tends to be a little lazy or maybe they're not <i>ahem</i> good at cooking.
			That's where We Deliver comes in to play. You tell us what you want to eat, we'll get it for from top-notch 
			restaurants in the Rochester Hills area. Our business is to bring the best of Rochester to your table.
